# HiveCorruptor
Have you been struggling to retain players? Everyone playing on the Hive instead of your server? Well,
struggle no more.

Introducing iHateHive, the best solution to solidify your position in the MCPE server space.

Add this plugin to your server and wait for your players to join. The plugin will corrupt the chunks on
the Hive and thus make it unplayable, thus forcing your players to join your server instead.

Like iHateHive? You'll love iHateGalaxite and iHateCubeCraft! Star this repository for news on those.
